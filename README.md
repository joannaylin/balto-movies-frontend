# balto-movies-frontend

## Items Completed
- Able to fetch movies from backend and render on frontend (index route, limited items to 10 due to file size)
- Render form to add movies
- Handle form submission to add movies
- Implemented toggle button for form 

## Struggles and Learnings
- Ability to render hindered by backend database structure. This led to reformatting data on the frontend for easier handling. This isn't a good idea in normal production. 


## If I could do it over again...
- Add styling to components
